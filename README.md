Due to climate change, global temperatures continue to rise making heat waves hotter and more frequent. A study showed that two-thirds of the total population lives in countries vulnerable to health threats from high summer temperatures, which causes heat exhaustion or heat stroke. During the summer, the most vulnerable people to the heat related illness are workers working outdoor. Most of the people donâ€™t have much knowledge about the health-related illness.
In this study, we have taken the available data from internet sources to analyze the key environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors causing heat stroke using the machine learning models available. These models help to predict and identify the features that contribute most to identifying heat stroke. Our finding indicated that the psychological behaviors "Rectal temperature" play an important role in analyzing heat stroke. Other factors like heat index, exposure to sun, and strenuous exercise have a significant role but are lesser.
Based on these insights a real time monitoring system is developed which can alert if any changes is responsible for heat stroke. Regular educational programs and campaigns also help to educate people about the causes of heat stroke.
